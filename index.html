                The programming adventure iniciated in the oddest of places, middle school...this is to test that this is a live server.
                Albeit not when I was in middle school, but rather teaching middle school technology! 
                Suprise, my students kept me on my toes with their tech saviness, and so was born a
                passion to explore digital media to educate the youth of NC by way of programing Arduino's 
                and learning basic CAD programs.Interestingly enough this was only the first step to my programing initiation
                I created my first basic webpage for my students ClassRoom Website.
                I edited video, linked useful sites and compiled teh class around adventureous yet
                controlled learning. In the end, it quite fun to build this Google site, but it was...
                limiting. I was proud of my work but it was elementary as far as web design goes in
                today's world. I wanted more - so I did the unthinkable in my wheelhouse - 
                I signed up for a Coding BootCamp at UNC-Chapel Hill.

                Currently, I am developing a working knowledge of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. 
                I plan to impliment this into my current job teaching but hope to have a new
                career in web development before the end of 2018.
